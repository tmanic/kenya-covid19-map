# 🗺️ COVID-19 Kenya County Dashboard (QGIS Project)

This project visualizes the spread of COVID-19 cases across counties in Kenya using QGIS. It integrates shapefile boundary data with CSV case data to create a thematic map showing the spatial distribution of the virus.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🧾 **Data Sources**:
  - County shapefiles: [Fezaro's GIS Repo](https://github.com/Fezaro/GIS-Data)
  - COVID-19 CSV data: Extracted and cleaned from public sources
- 🗃️ Tools used: [QGIS](https://qgis.org), CSV/Excel, GitHub
- 🖼️ Output: A choropleth map showing COVID-19 cases by county

## 📍 Objectives

- Visualize COVID-19 intensity geographically across Kenya
- Understand which counties were most affected
- Provide an open and replicable workflow for spatial analysis in public health

## 🛠️ How to Reproduce

1. **Clone the Repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-kenya-qgis.git
   cd covid-kenya-qgis
